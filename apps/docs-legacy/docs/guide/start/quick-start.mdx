# Why We Built Another Form Library üöÄ

At Graneet, we deal with large forms containing up to 1000 inputs displayed simultaneously. We've used popular libraries like Formik and React Hook Form in the past, but none could meet our specific requirements.

## Formik
While Formik is a solid library, we encountered significant performance issues üêå. The library wasn't designed with large-scale performance in mind, leading to excessive page loads and updates due to frequent re-renders.

## React Hook Form
React Hook Form is known for its excellent performance and API design. However, we faced two critical issues:
- **Error handling triggers excessive renders**: The library manages errors in a large object without a granular subscription system, causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Multi-step form complexity**: Integrating forms into our multi-step workflows proved challenging. We initially developed a solution on top of React Hook Form (see our CTO's POC from several years ago: https://github.com/orgs/react-hook-form/discussions/1979), but increasing complexity made our overlay unmaintainable

These challenges led us to build a library tailored to our specific needs.

# Key Features üéÅ

Graneet Form is built with performance as a core principle. Our key features include:

- **Granular subscription system**: Watch specific fields or entire forms without unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimized error handling**: Efficient error management that doesn't trigger cascade re-renders
- **Built-in wizard system**: Native support for multi-step forms with seamless navigation
