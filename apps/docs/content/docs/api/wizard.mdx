# Wizard System

Graneet Form includes a built-in wizard system for creating multi-step forms with seamless navigation and state management.

## Coming Soon

The wizard system documentation is being prepared. This will include:

- `useWizard` hook for managing multi-step forms
- Wizard component for navigation
- Step validation and progression
- State management across steps
- Integration with form validation

For now, you can explore the wizard components in the source code:

- `/packages/graneet-form/src/wizard/`

## Basic Concept

```tsx
// Example of what the wizard API will look like
const wizard = useWizard({
  steps: [
    { component: <PersonalInfoStep /> },
    { component: <ContactInfoStep /> },
    { component: <PreferencesStep /> }
  ]
});

return (
  <Wizard wizard={wizard}>
    {/* Navigation and step content */}
  </Wizard>
);
```
