## Key Concepts

The Graneet Form API is built around these core concepts:

- **Form Instance**: Created by `useForm`, manages all form state
- **Field Registration**: Fields register themselves and subscribe to changes
- **Granular Subscriptions**: Only affected components re-render
- **Validation System**: Built-in validation with custom rules
- **Wizard Support**: Native multi-step form functionality
