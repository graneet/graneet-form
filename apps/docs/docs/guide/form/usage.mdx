import { IFrame } from "../../../src/components/IFrame";

# Usage

You can build strongly typed forms with a simple syntax.

## Explanation

The library has a concept of registered fields. When an input (wrapped with the library components) is rendered with JSX, it is automatically registered and will be able to access, update, or watch its value.

## Example

In this example, we are building a simple form with one input that has a default value.

<IFrame model="simple-form" />

## Accessing Form Data in Nested Components

To avoid prop drilling the form instance from `useForm`, you can use `useFormContext` inside any component that is a child of the `Form` component. This hook provides access to the form's state and methods without having to pass props down through multiple component levels.

```tsx
import { useFormContext } from '@graneet-form';

function NestedComponent() {
  const form = useFormContext();
  
  // Access form methods and state
  const values = form.getFormValues();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your nested component content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
