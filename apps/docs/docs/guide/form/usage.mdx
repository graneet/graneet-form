import { IFrame } from "../../../src/components/IFrame";

# Usage

You can build forms strongly types with a simple syntax.

## Explanation

The library has a concept of registered field. When an input (having the library wrapper) is rendered with JSX. It is registered and will be
able to see, update or watch its value.

## Example

In this example, we are building a simple form with one input with a default value.

<IFrame model="simple-form" />

## Access to form in nested component of `Form`

To avoid prop drilling of form from `useForm`, you can use `useFormContext` inside a component, child of `Form`
